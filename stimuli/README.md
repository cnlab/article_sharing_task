#Stimuli

This folder stores the stimuli files that are needed to properly run the task. Two files are needed (one for each run) per subject. 

Here is a key of what each column means:
1. headline: text of the headline of the article for the trial.<br>
2. abstract: text of the abstract of the article for the trial.<br>
3. id: article ID <br>
4. content: the 'content' topic that the participant will be randomly asked about - only applies to the content condition.<br>
5. time: the length of the screen where participants read (and heard in headphones) the article headline and abstract.
